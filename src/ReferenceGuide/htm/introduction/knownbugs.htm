Known bugs and limitations in release 8.0</h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>Using old version model files.</b>
	Existing results related to FE parts and beams created in older versions
	of FEDEM are not recognized when the model is opened in version 7.0 and later.
	This is due to the change of "Link" to "Part" or "Beam" as type names of these objects.
	The old FRS-files use the "Link" keyword which is no longer recognized.
	The solution is to delete all results, including the reduction if component modes
	have been used, and do a new simulation.

	<li><b>Memory overflow for large models.</b>
	When running an animation over a long time series for a large model, the memory my be exhausted.
	Resolve by closing the animation window after a solving process is started, or toggle off
	"Automatically start a simultaneous Rigid Body animation on solver start" in the Output tab of
	the Advanced Solver Setup dialog.

	<li><b>Exporting animation aborts the GUI.</b>
	When exporting an animation to MPEG or AVI,
	the user interface shuts down after the export is finished.

	<li><b>Graph view and properties.</b>
	The sub-title field is now absent.

	<li><b>Number of curve symbols.</b>
	It is not possible to select how many symbols to use on each curve.
	There will always be one symbol for each data point, or no symbols at all.

	<li><b>Zoom with auto-scale.</b>
	The button and menu entry for zooming a graph view with auto-scaling
	to the windowed curve points is no longer available.

	<li><b>Print graph view.</b>
	The button and menu entry for printing a graph view is no longer available.
</ul>
