<p>FEDEM, an acronym for Finite Element Dynamics in Elastic Mechanisms,
provides a technology platform and an engineering framework for virtual testing
of complex mechanical assemblies. It contains a complete set of features to
create, solve and post-process a model in a 3D graphical environment.
Dynamics results in the form of graphs and animations are available during and
after the model simulation. Combined with the fast and numerically stable FEDEM
solvers, the graphical user interface facilitates an engineering process with
shortened turnaround times and quick access to simulation results for a clearer
understanding of the physical behavior of the model. FEDEM also provides
intuitive and high-performing post-processing capabilities, including full
stress analysis, eigenmode solutions, strain gage solutions and fatigue analysis
for selected time steps.</p>

<h2>Nonlinear structural dynamics</h2>
<p>In multibody applications, such as car bodies and suspension systems,
axle systems, satellite appendages, industrial manipulators, medical equipment,
high-speed mechatronic systems and so on, some of the mechanism components can
be flexible and can experience large elastic deflections and coupling effects.
To ensure sufficient accuracy, the numerical simulation must account for the
mutual dependencies between dynamic properties at the system level and
structural flexibility at the component level. These requirements can be
efficiently satisfied through a nonlinear structural dynamics approach.</p>

<p>In FEDEM, a nonlinear structural dynamics approach is utilized in order to
simultaneously solve structural deformations and 3D motion dynamics in the time
domain. The mechanical assembly to be simulated consists of structural Parts,
each represented by a linear elastic finite element (FE) model or a simplified
stiffness description (Generic Part), and are coupled together with linear or
nonlinear joints. The model may also contain axial spring- and damper elements,
as well as individual beam elements. After a model reduction of each FE part
based on a dynamic superelement formulation, the system equations are assembled
and solved with respect to FE degrees of freedom (DOFs), allowing for large
translations and rotation according to a co-rotated theory.</p>


<h2>Control systems in mechanical analysis</h2>
<p>A mechanical system is often in a control loop including sensors measuring
states in the mechanism, compensators representing control algorithms,
and servo, hydraulic, or electrical actuators generating the energy to drive
the mechanism. These control modules and the mechanism must be integrated
simultaneously in order to ensure sufficient accuracy of the results.</p>

<p>To model your control systems, FEDEM provides the Control Editor modeling
environment, which combines the FEDEM look-and-feel with graphical modeling
tools similar to those of MATLAB®/Simulink®. These modeling tools are crucial
when creating models of mechanical systems such as robots, milling machines,
and space mechanisms.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the internal control system, FEDEM also provides a
user-defined functions interface through which the actuator and/or force inputs
are defined in a dynamic link library (DLL) that users may program themselves.
</p>


<h2>What is a FEDEM model?</h2>
<p>A <i>FEDEM model</i> is a virtual test model designed by you to simulate your
mechanical systems. The virtual test model is an assembly of individual parts.
The mechanical properties of the parts can be represented by either an FE model
a simplified stiffness/mass description (generic Parts) or one beam element.
You connect parts, joints, springs, and other elements to create an accurate
virtual test model of a movable mechanical system or <i>mechanism</i>.</p>

<p>To minimize the time needed to calculate and simulate mechanisms,
model reduction process of FEDEM reduces each FE model to a superelement with
external nodes. These external nodes are defined at FE nodes that serve as
connections between the various model entities in the assembly.</p>

<p>Once constructed, a FEDEM model retains the FE characteristics of its
component parts, and can therefore be treated as a <i>geometrically nonlinear
FE model</i>. The mechanism is then allowed to experience large translations,
rotations, and nonlinear, behavior-dependent loads in the simulation of its
dynamic motion.</p>

<p>Functions, measured time-history input data and control systems can be used
to model virtual test events by controlling loads, motion, spring lengths,
etc.</p>

<p>The FEDEM solvers can then calculate the motion kinematics, dynamics,
structural flexibility, stresses and strains in a single consistent model.</p>


<h2>Using FE models</h2>
<p>FEDEM can import FE models created in external systems by interfacing with
the MSC.Nastran® Bulk Data File (<i>.bdf</i> and <i>.nas</i>) format.
Many FE modeling systems (including I-DEAS®, Pro/ENGINEER®, Altair® HyperMesh®,
NEiWorks/NEiFusion and MSC/Patran®) can export FE models on the Bulk Data File
format, enabling you to use your favorite FE modeling program with FEDEM.</p>

<p>FEDEM can also import FE models which are saved on the SESAM input interface
file (.FEM) format.</p>

<p>Each FE model must include its nodal coordinates and attributes,
element topology, element properties, material data, and so on. The results
obtained in the simulation depend to a large extent on the FE models used.
To create a satisfactory model of a real structure, the analyst therefore must
combine insight into the nature of the problem, experience with the <i>Finite
Element Method</i> (FEM), and knowledge of the general rules of FE modeling.</p>


<h2>FEDEM solver modules</h2>
<p>FEDEM uses separate program modules to perform the different type of
calculations on the model. Thus, there are modules for the model reduction,
dynamic mechanism simulation, stress and mode shape recovery, strain rosette
analysis and strain coat analysis. The execution of each solver module is
managed from the graphical user interface of FEDEM. However, they may also be
run separately as batch processes from a console window.</p>

<p>The FEDEM solver modules are described briefly in the following.</p>

<h3>Reducer</h3>
<p>The FEDEM Reducer module performs a superelement reduction of the FE model
representing the mass and stiffness of a part. A superelement reduction reduces
the required DOF to a minimum. The retained DOFs, also called external DOFs,
are the results of a dynamic superelement reduction technique called Component
Mode Synthesis reduction, also known as CMS reduction.</p>

<h3>Dynamics Solver</h3>
<p>The FEDEM Dynamics Solver module performs a nonlinear dynamics simulation.
This means a simulation of the motion and deformations of the superelements and
joints, as they respond to load and displacement time histories and
Control System output. At any time step during the simulation, the model can be
linearized whereby an eigenvalue analysis can be performed to study the free
vibration properties of the mechanism at the deformed state.</p>

<h3>Stress Recovery</h3>
<p>The FEDEM Stress Recovery module recovers displacements of the internal DOFs
of an FE part from the displacements of the external DOFs simulated by the
Dynamics Solver. Element strains and stresses are then calculated.</p>

<h3>Mode Shape Recovery</h3>
<p>The FEDEM Mode Shape Recovery module recovers the mode shapes of each FE part
from the Eigenvalue results of the Dynamic Solver.</p>

<h3>Strain Rosette Analysis</h3>
<p>The FEDEM Strain Rosette Analysis module recovers the stresses and strains on
<i>virtual strain gages</i> on FE parts, based on the Dynamic Solver results.
The output is time history data of stresses and strains similar to output from
real strain gages on phyical structures.</p>

<h3>Strain Coat Analysis</h3>
<p>The FEDEM Strain Coat Analysis module recovers the stresses and strains on
<i>strain coat elements</i> on FE parts, and calculates a summary of the
recovered results over its entire time history. The output from this analysis
is maximums of certain stress/strain quantities over time,
as well as Fatigue results (estimated damage/life).</p>
