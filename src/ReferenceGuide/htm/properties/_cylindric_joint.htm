<h1><a name="cylindric-joint"></a>Cylindric Joint</h1>

<p>The Cylindric joint object is used to represent a Cylindric joint in a FEDEM model.</p>

<p>A Cylindric joint consists of a slave triad sliding along a straight path
defined by two or more master triads. The local coordinate system of the joint
is defined with its Z-axis directed along the slide path. The X- and Y-axes
are then defined from the coordinate systems of the master triads.</p>

<p>The Cylindric joint has four unconstrained DOFs that allow for translational
displacement along the local Z-axis, and rotation about all three axes.
It has two joint DOFs with property settings. They allow you to control the
translational displacement of the slave triad relative to the first master triad
along the local Z-axis (the slider variable), and the
angle of rotation of the slave triad about the local Z-axis, respectively.
The rotation angle is measured between the X-axis of the first master triad and
the X-axis of the slave triad.
It does not constrain motion in the other two rotational directions.</p>

<p>See the section on "Joints" in the "Mechanism Elements" chapter in the
FEDEM User's Guide, for more information on Cylindric joints.</p>
