<h1><a name="_properties_part"></a>Part</h1>

<p>The Part object is used to represent structural parts in the FEDEM model.
Parts are the basic components of a mechanism model. Each part is either a FE
Part or a Generic Part.</p>

<p>The mass-, stiffness- and dynamic properties of an FE Part are derived
from its finite element (FE) model, which is composed of a set of nodal points,
elements, material- and geometric property data. The FE model must be constructed
in an external FE modeler and then imported into FEDEM.</p>

<p>A Generic Part is a simplified flexible body. It can be used when you
have no FE model available, when trying to optimize hardpoint positions,
or when the flexibility of the part is considered to be insignificant.
It can also have a separate geometry file attached,
to give a realistic visualization of it.
A Generic Part is purely defined by its connection points, mass properties
at its centre of gravity, and the stiffness at connection points.
The stiffness can either be defined manually, or automatically set to some very
high value, mimicking a semi-rigid body. See the FEDEM Theory Guide,
Appendix A.16 "Generic Part element", for details on how a Generic Part is
represented in the Dynamics Solver.</p>

<p>In addition to the Part object, a structural part in FEDEM may also be
represented by a single, two-noded beam element. This is somewhat equivalent to
a Generic Part with two connection points, except that the mass- and stiffness
matrices now are derived consistently from a linear beam finite element,
instead of using the semi-rigid representation. Such elements are denoted
<a href="beam.htm">Beams</a> in the Model Manager panel.</p>

<p>The Part properties are separated into several tabs to organize the different
settings in a logic manner. The number of tabs and their content depend on
whether the Part is defined as a Generic Part or an FE Part,
or if it used for visualization only.</p>


<h2><a name="Part"></a>Part tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-1.png"></p>
<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-2.png"></p>

<p>The two figures above illustrate the <i>Part</i> properties,
for an FE Part and a Generic Part, respectively.
The properties consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>FE Part /<br> Generic Part</td><td>These are the part type selector
which toggle between the FE and the Generic representations. You can switch
part type at any time during modeling (until you have simulation results).
Note that FEDEM will try to use the supplied FE- and Visualization data in a
sensible way when switching the part type. If imported as an FE Part and
switched to Generic Part, the FE model is retained in memory and used for
visualization, unless a specific <i>Visualization</i> file is specified.
FEDEM will not drop the FE data from memory until you actively enter or change
the visualization file name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visualization only</td><td>If the Part is toggled as visualization only,
it will be ignored by the solvers and practically serve as an extension of the
<a href="reference-plane.htm">Reference plane</a>. All
<a href="triad.htm">Triads</a> attached to the Part will then appear as fixed
to ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repository entry</td><td>Indicates repository type (<i>[internal]</i>
or <i>[external]</i>), and the name of the FE data file in the part database of
the current model. If the current model has not yet been saved to file, this
entry will state the file name FEDEM will use when you do save it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Imported file</td><td>Indicates the name and location of the originally
imported FE model file. The unit conversion that was applied during the import,
if any, is also displayed next to the file name.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change...</td><td>This button inside the <i>Finite Element Model</i>
frame allows you to replace the FE model of the Part with a new one.
The button triggers a file dialog in which the new FE model can be chosen.
Note that all mechanism entities attached to the Part, that do not not have
corresponding nodal points in the new FE model, will be detached when you
replace the FE model.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reduced [n]</td><td>Indicates whether your FE model has been reduced
or not. If reduced FE data exist and is recognized to match the Part, this label
will read <i>Reduced [n]</i>, where the <i>n</i> is a number referring to the
folder in the part database containing the reduced FE matrices. Otherwise, the
label will read <i>Needs reduction</i>.
<tr><td>Visualization</td><td>Specifies path to a geometry file (e.g., VRML)
to be used for visualization of Generic Parts.
Use the <i>Change...</i> button within this frame to browse for a file.
If a valid FE model file already has been specified, FEDEM will use that model
for visualization until a separate visualization file name is entered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Structural Damping</td><td>Allows you to change the values of the mass-
and stiffness-proportional damping for the Part. These parameters are described
in the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 7.5 "Structural damping".</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scaling of Dynamic Properties</td><td>Allows you to scale the stiffness
and mass of each individual Part in the dynamics simulation. The scaling is
applied during initialization and stays in effect for the entire simulation.
This option can be useful for sensitivity studies of deflection and stiffness.
</td></tr></table></p>

<p>Regarding the stiffness and mass scaling, and the structural damping,
it is important to be aware of the following:<ul>
<li>The scaling is not accounted for in any of the FE recovery analyses,
and the recovered result will thus be misleading on FE Parts using
stiffness scaling and/or mass scaling.
<li>The damping matrix and the associated force vector are not affected by the
stiffness- and mass scaling parameters. That is, when using mass- and/or
stiffness-proportional damping, it is the unscaled mass- and stiffness matrices
that contribute to the damping matrix and force vector.
<li>The stiffness- and mass scaling is not accounted for during FE reduction.
Therefore, the component mode shapes are always computed from the
unscaled matrices. Using stiffness scaling and/or mass scaling on an
FE Part having component modes might thus yield inaccurate results unless the
two scaling factors are equal, because the component modes then are computed
from a different set of matrices than the one used in the dynamics simulation.
</ul></p>


<h2><a name="Origin"></a>Origin tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-3.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Origin</i> properties of the Part.
The fields here have similar interpretation as in the
<a href="triad.htm#Origin">Origin tab</a> of the Triad property panel.</p>


<h2><a name="FE-Node"></a>FE Node tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-10.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>FE Node</i> properties
(for FE Parts only), which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>FE Node</td><td>ID number of the FE node which is closest to the picked
location in the Modeler.
If the part is selected from the Object Browser, a value -1 is shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reference</td><td>Toggles display of <i>Global</i> vs. <i>Local</i>
(with respect to the Part origin) coordinates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>X, Y and Z</td><td>Global or local coordinates of the picked FE node.
</td></tr>
</table></p>


<h2><a name="Reduction-Options"></a>Reduction Options tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-4.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Reduction Options</i> properties
(for FE Parts only), which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Singularity criterion</td><td>Tolerance used to decide whether the the
stiffness- and mass matrices are singular when they are factorized during the
FE model reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component modes</td><td>Number of component modes representing all
internal (eliminated) nodal DOFs after CMS model reduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eigenvalue tolerance</td><td>Maximum acceptable relative error in
the computed eigenvalues in the fixed boundary eigenvalue analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Consistent mass matrix</td><td>Enables the use of consistent mass matrix
in the FE model reduction process. If disabled, a lumped mass matrix approach
is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ignore check-sum test</td><td>This toggle disables the check on whether
the reduced FE data is consistent with the FE model file currently used.
FEDEM may in some rare events signal that a part file needs reduction even
though consistent reduced data are present.
Do <u>not</u> use this toggle unless you are sure that the
reduced FE data found on disk are compatible with the current model.
The consequence of using incompatible FE data may be a diverging model or
incorrect results. FEDEM issues a warning message to the user whenever this
toggle is enabled to stress this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Expand mode shapes</td><td>Enables expansion of the component mode
shapes and the free-free mode shapes of the reduced part,
for subsequent animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eigenvalue Factorization</td><td>Specifies which matrix to be
Choleski-factorized during the eigenvalue analysis that is performed in the
component modes computation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recovery matrix storage precision</td><td>Toggles between Single and
Double precision storage of the recovery matrix (a.k.a. the <b>B</b>-matrix)
on disk. Using single precision storage will reduce the needed disk space for
this matrix by 50%, and might be advantageous for very large parts with many
Triads that will result in a big <b>B</b>-matrix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reduced [n] /<br>Needs reduction</td><td>
See <a href="#Part">Part tab</a>.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Switching to single precision storage of the <b>B</b>-matrix should normally
have no influence on the dynamics simulation results. However, if the FE model
is poorly conditioned (e.g., there is a large span in its stiffness properties)
there might be minor loss of accuracy in the recovery results due to truncation
of the <b>B</b>-matrix elements stored on file. For FE Parts that are reduced
with component modes, the single/double precision storage option also applies
to the file containing the component mode shapes (the <b>E</b>-matrix file).</p>


<h2><a name="Advanced"></a>Advanced tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-5.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Advanced</i> properties of the Part,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Positioning algorithm<br>
for co-rotated reference coordinate system:</td>
<td>The options in this pull-down list are as follows:<br>
<i>Model default</i> - The setting defined in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Integration">Integration tab</a>
of the Dynamics Solver Setup dialog box is used.<br>
<i>Max triangle, with unit offset when necessary</i> - The original algorithm,
and the only one available in FEDEM R3.1.1 and earlier.<br>
<i>Max triangle, with scaled offset when necessary</i> - The same as above,
but with adjustments of the offset to better fit the size of the Part.<br>
<i>Mass based nodal average</i> - Algorithm based on equilibrium of a rigid
shadow element with averaged stiffnesses at the triads.<br>
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 4.1 "Superelement local coordinate system"
for a detailed description of these algorithms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Centripetal force correction:</td><td>
The options in this pull-down list are as follows:<br>
<i>Model default</i> - The setting defined in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Integration">Integration tab</a>
of the Dynamics Solver Setup dialog box is used.<br>
<i>On</i> - Turns centripetal force correction on for this Part.<br>
<i>Off</i> - Turns centripetal force correction off for this Part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Perform stress recovery during dynamics simulation</td><td>
Enables recovery of internal displacements (deformation) and von Mises stresses
for all elements of this FE Part during the dynamics simulation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Perform strain rosette recovery during dynamics simulation</td><td>
Enables recovery of stresses and strains in the strain rosette elements
defined on this FE Part during the dynamics simulation.
If any of the strain rosette elements on the selected part are used as Argument
in a <a href="function.htm">Function</a>, this toggle will be automatically
enabled for that part when the Dynamics Solver is started.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Skip stress recovery for this part</td><td>
This toggle can be used to skip the FE part when running stress recovery
as a post-process over the entire model.
It has no effect when solving stress recovery on a selection
of parts or on individual element groups.
</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Caution: Performing stress recovery during the dynamics simulation
is a costly operation. So for models with large FE Parts, this will increase
the total simulation time considerably. Therefore, use this feature only if
the simulation time of the Dynamics Solver is not essential.</p>


<h2><a name="Mass"></a>Mass tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-6.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Mass</i> properties
(for Generic Parts only), which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Specify mass, inertia and CoG</td><td>The mass and inertias of the Part
must be specified explicitly in the <i>Mass and Inertia</i> fields.
The centre of gravity must also be specified in the <a href="#CoG">CoG tab</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Calculate from FE model</td><td>The mass, inertias, and the centre
of gravity of the Part will be calculated from the FE model associated with it.
The <i>Inertia Reference</i> is also be set to <i>Part Orientation</i>
and editing of the <i>Mass and Inertia</i> fields are disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Calculate from CAD geometry</td><td>The mass, inertias, and the centre
of gravity of the Part will be calculated from the <i>Visualization</i> file
associated with it, and the chosen <i>Material</i>.
The <i>Inertia Reference</i> is also be set to <i>Part Orientation</i>
and editing of the <i>Mass and Inertia</i> fields are disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Material</td><td>If the <i>Calculate from CAD geometry</i> toggle is
enabled, this pull-down list can be used to select the <a href="material.htm">
Material</a> object from which the mass density to be used in the mass property
calculation is taken. If no Material is selected, the value &rho;=7850.0 is used
(appropriate for steel).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inertia Reference</td><td>Select whether to specify the inertia in the
directions of the Part coordinate system, or in the directions specified as
Principal Axes of Inertia on the <a href="#CoG">CoG tab</a>.
<tr><td>Mass</td><td>The total mass of the Part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ixx - Izz</td><td>The lower triangle of the inertia matrix at the centre
of gravity of the Part.</td></tr>
</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Appendix A.16 "Generic Part element", for how
these properties are used to construct the mass matrix of the Generic Part.</p>


<h2><a name="Stiffness"></a>Stiffness tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-7.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Stiffness</i> properties
(for Generic Parts only), which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Automatic / Manual</td><td>Toggles whether to set the overall
Generic Part stiffness manually, or to have FEDEM calculate a near rigid
stiffness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Translational stiffness at each triad</td><td>
Manually defined translational stiffness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rotational stiffness at each triad</td><td>
Manually defined rotational stiffness.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>When setting the stiffness calculations to Automatic, FEDEM uses the
specified mass and a high target eigenfrequency to calculate a sensible high
stiffness. This will work as long as the mass of the Part is set to something
reasonable. Thus, FEDEM is not able to calculate a good stiffness for a Part
with no mass at all, or with a mass that does not correspond to the actual use.
In such cases you will need to set the stiffness manually.</p>

<p>See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Appendix A.16, "Generic part element" for details
on how the Dynamics Solver calculates the stiffness matrix for the Generic Part
from the specified stiffness values.</p>


<h2><a name="CoG"></a>CoG tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-8.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Center of Gravity (CoG)</i> properties
(for Generic Parts only), which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Center of Gravity</td><td>These fields specify the centre of gravity
position of the Part. They work in a similar way as the <i>Position</i> fields
of the <a href="triad.htm#Origin">Origin tab</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Principal Axes of Inertia</td><td>These fields specify the principal
axes of inertia of the Part, which are used as reference frame for the inertias
specified on the <a href="#Mass">Mass tab</a>.
They work in a similar way as the <i>Orientation</i> fields
of the <a href="triad.htm#Origin">Origin tab</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Condense out CoG DOFs</td><td>Enables the elimination of the six DOFs
associated with the centre of gravity in the dynamics simulation. It can be used
to remove potential artificial internal vibrations in the Generic Part,
and thus increase the numerical stability of the model.</td></tr>
</table></p>


<h2><a name="Hydrodynamics"></a>Hydrodynamics tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/part-9.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Hydrodynamics</i> properties
(for Generic Parts only), which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Perform buoyancy calculations</td><td>
Enables the calculation of buoyancy forces for this Part, provided a geometry
description file has been specified in the <i>Visualization</i> file field of
the <a href="#Part">Part tab</a>. This geometry file has to define
a closed volume that represents the total displaced fluid body when the
Part is submerged. It can be either on the VRML-format, or FEDEM's internal
CAD format (.ftc).</td></tr>
