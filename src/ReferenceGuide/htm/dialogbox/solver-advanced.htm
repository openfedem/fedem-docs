<h1><a name="_dialogbox_solver-advanced"></a>Solver (Advanced)</h1>

<p>The control parameters for the Dynamics Solver are placed on six tabs 
labeled Time, Integration, Tolerances, Eigenmode, Initial Equilibrium, 
and Output.</p>

<h2><a name="Time">Time tab</h2>

<p>The time domain of the dynamics simulation is controlled through the 
following parameters:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-advanced1.png" width="328" height="464"></p>

<p><ol>
<li>You can define the Start time and the Stop time of the dynamics simulation.
<li>You can define the size of the Time increment to be used by the time
integration algorithm. In addition to a constant value, you may also select a
<a href="../properties/function.htm">Function</a> or a Time history input file
from the pull-down list, in order to obtain a varying time increment size.
In that case, the Minimum time increment is used as a lower bound.
<li>You can enable/disable the use of Iteration cut-back when the dynamics
simulation diverges, and adjust the Step size reduction factor defining the size
of the new time step to use in the cut-back, and the Number of time steps with
reduced size before the normal step size is resumed. If the cut-back iterations
also diverge, another cut-back is attempted by applying the Step size
reduction factor again. This procedure is then repeated until
convergence is obtained or the Minimum time increment is reached. In
the latter case, the simulation is aborted.
<li>You can enable a Restart simulation if you already have some
simulation results, and specify the Restart time defining the time step
to restart from. If the specified time does not match an existing time
step, the closest step after the specified time is used.</ol></p>

<p><i>NOTE: In a restart simulation, you are allowed to adjust any of the 
other Solver Setup parameters and options, as well as adjusting the additional 
solver options for the Dynamics solver (see the User's Guide, 
"Additional solver options"). However, you can not change any properties of the 
mechanism model itself.</i></p>

<p>Restarting a Dynamics simulation is very handy if you discover you need to 
continue a simulation that was terminated abnormally, or you just want a longer 
event than was originally defined. You may restart a simulation as many times 
you wish.</p>

<p>Each restart adds a new set of result files to the existing results 
database such that subsequent post-processing and recovery runs can be 
conducted over the overall time domain spanned by both the initial run and 
the restart(s). If the time domain of the individual runs overlap, only the 
latest produced results will be used in post-processing and recovery. See 
the User's Guide, "Result files from restart simulations" 
for more information on the management of results from restart simulations.</p>


<h2><a name="Integration">Integration tab</h2>

<p>You can optimize numerical performance of the time integration
by adjusting the following parameters:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-advanced2.png" width="328" height="464"></p>

<p><ol>
<li>You can select among the following three integration algorithms.
Refer to the FEDEM Theory Guide, Chapter 7 "Dynamic Simulation"
for details on these integration methods.<ul>
<li>Standard Newmark without numerical damping
<li>The Hilber-Hughes-Taylor method
(the amount of damping &alpha;<sub>H</sub> = 0.1 is then recommended).
This is the default setting.
<li>The generalized-&alpha; method.
<br><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-genalpha.png"><br>
This method allows for a separate numerical damping parameter (&alpha;<sub>m</sub>-factor)
for the inertia terms, whereas the other parameter (&alpha;<sub>f</sub> -factor)
applies to stiffness- and damping terms, as well as the external loads,
see section 7.4.3 in the FEDEM Theory Guide.
</ul>
<li>You can enable/disable the use of Integration tolerances, and specify the Maximum and
Minimum number of iterations for each time increment. When Ignore integration
tolerances is set, a fixed Number of iterations is specified instead.
<li>The nonlinear equations are solved using Modified Newton-Raphson iterations
meaning that the system matrices are not necessarily recalculated in each iteration.
For efficiency reasons, the number of matrix updates per time step should be as low as possible.
However, if the increments in the input variables are large during a
time step, the system matrices need to be updated more often, to
ensure the nonlinear iterations converge.<br>
You may choose between Fixed number of matrix updates or Variable number of 
matrix updates. In either case you can also specify the Number of initial iterations 
with matrix updates and the Maximum sequential iterations with no matrix updates. 
The first number defines how many iterations in the beginning of each time step should be
performed with updated matrices. If the iterations have not converged before reaching 
that number, the subsequent iterations are performed with a matrix update frequency 
defined by the Maximum sequential iterations with no matrix updates. However, if 
Variable number of matrix updates is chosen, a convergence based threshold is used 
in addition to determine when to do further system matrix updates. The factor entered 
in Convergence tolerance factor for matrix updates is then multiplied with the active 
convergence tolerances specified on the <a href="#Tolerances">Tolerances tab</a>.
The resulting tolerance is compared to the error norms corresponding to the
active convergence tolerances and the matrices are updated
as long as the error norm is higher than this tolerance.
<li>You can specify the default algorithm for calculation of the co-rotated
part coordinate systems during the simulation. The selections available in
this pull-down list correspond to those of the similar pull-down list in the
<a href="../properties/part.htm#Advanced">Advanced tab</a>
of the Part property panel. The setting here applies to all parts in the model,
where the corresponding setting on the part level is <i>Model default</i>.
<li>You can enable/disable Geometric stiffness contributions
during the non-linear iterations. This option accounts for
stress stiffening in FE parts, beams, and axial springs and -dampers.
It may affect the convergence of the nonlinear iterations if the mechanism
contains FE parts with large membrane forces, and/or beams, axial springs and dampers
with large axial forces. This is because the forces alter the bending- or rotational
stiffness of these elements. A tensile membrane/axial force will effectively increase
the bending/rotational stiffness and a compressive force will reduce the bending/rational
stiffness. For information on the computation of the geometric stiffness on FE parts,
see the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 4.4 "Superelement tangent stiffness".
<li>You can enable/disable Centripetal moment correction.
This implies an improved representation of the inertia forces on FE parts
that have only a few Triads, but experience high-speed rotations
(see the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 3.3 "Inertia forces and
high-speed rotation" for details).
</ol></p>


<h2><a name="Tolerances">Tolerances tab</h2>

<p>Convergence criteria for the dynamics analysis are defined by enabling one, or more, convergence tolerances:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-advanced3.png" width="328" height="464"></p>

<p><ol>
<li>The Displacement Interation Correction allows you to enable/disable and set convergence tolerances for
the Displacement iteration corrections.
<li>You can define a convergence criterion on Velocity iteration correction
<li>You can define various tolerances for Unbalanced forces.
<li>You can define convergence tolerances for iteration energy changes.
<li>All available convergence tests can be ignored or defined into one of two sets
of tests: In set A, all tests must be satisfied for convergence to be satisfied. In set O, only
one of the tests must be satisfied (in addition to all the tests in set A)
for convergence to be satisfied.
</ol></p>

<p>The various norms used in the above convergence criteria have different
dimension properties. Some are dimensionless, whereas others depend on the
model units. The default values defined are suitable for the SI unit set.
If you model in a different unit set (see <a href="model-preferences.htm">
Model preferences</a>), you will need to adjust some of your active tolerance
values accordingly.</p>

<p>The scaled vector norm of the displacement correction is dimensionless, 
whereas the same norm for the velocity correction has dimension 1/[time] and 
for the force residual it is [force][length]. The Max norms have the dimension 
corresponding to the quantity that they measure.</p>

<p>For more information about convergence criteria, see the FEDEM Theory Guide, 
Section 7.2.1 "Convergence criteria".</p>


<h2><a name="Eigenmode">Eigenmode tab</h2>

<p>You can set up the calculation of eigenmode solutions (see "Modal analysis"
in the User's Guide) by adjusting the following parameters:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-advanced4.png" width="328" height="464"></p>

<p><ol>
<li>The Perform Eigenmode Solution option allows you to enable/disable calculation of the eigenmode solutions.
<li>You can specify the number of eigenmodes to be computed.
<li>You can specify the time interval between each eigenvalue analysis.
<li>You can specify an Eigenmode Shift (see the FEDEM Theory Guide,
Section 9.7.4 "Using shift when solving the eigenvalue problem").
<li>You can enable/disable the application of the Additional Boundary Conditions
specified for <a href="../properties/triad.htm">Triads</a>.
<li>You can enable/disable computation of damped eigenmodes by
accounting for structural damping (see the FEDEM Theory Guide,
Section 9.7.2 "Damped eigenvalue problem").<br>
CAUTION: Computation of damped eigenmodes takes considerably longer 
time than computing the undamped modes.
<li>You can enable/disable the Geometric Stiffness Contribution in the
eigenvalue analyses (see the similar option in the <a href="#Integration">
Integration tab</a>). If the mechanism contains structural members that
experience large tensile or compression forces at certain time steps,
the geometric stiffness contribution may have a significant effect
on the accuracy on the computed eigenvalues at those time steps.</ol></p>


<h2><a name="Initial-Equilibrium">Initial Equilibrium tab</h2>

<p>If, during modeling, your model is not positioned at its (static) equilibrium position,
it is recommended that you perform Initial Equilibrium analysis to move the mechanism
to a resting position before simulating the dynamics.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-advanced5.png" width="328" height="464"></p>

<p><ol>
<li>You can enable the <i>Perform static equilibrium iterations at initial position</i>
option, to perform static equilibrium iterations on the modelling configuration.
<li>You can adjust the <i>Equilibrium iteration tolerance</i> and the <i>Iteration step-size limit</i>
for the initial static equilibrium iterations (see below).
<li>You can enable/disable the <i>Geometric stiffness contribution</i> in the initial static
equilibrium iterations (see similar option in the <a href="#Integration">Integration tab</a>).
<li>You can enable the <i>Perform dynamic ramp-up of loads/motions</i> option, as an alternative to
(or instead of) the initial static equilibirum iterations (see below).
<li>You can enable/disable <i>Ramp-up gravity forces as well</i>,
which can be useful for models of heavy structures.
<li>You can specify the <i>Number of increments in ramp-up stage</i>.
The time step size of the ramp-up stage will then equal the Total length of the ramp-up stage,
divided by this value.
<li>You can adjust the <i>Maximum gradient during ramp-up stage</i>.
The maximum gradient of the applied load/motions (and possibly gravity loads) will then equal
<li>You can adjust the <i>Total length (in time) of ramp-up stage</i>.
<li>You can specify a <i>Time with constant loads after ramp-up</i>.
Usually zero is sufficient, but this can be used to allow the mechanism to approach a steady state
with lower velocities/accelerations, before the actual load history is applied.
</ol></p>

<p>The Equilibrium iteration tolerance is the convergence criterion on the norm
of the iterative displacement correction during the static equilibrium iterations
(equivalent to the Scaled vector norm tolerance for Displacement iteration
correction in the <a href="#Tolerances">Tolerances tab</a>).</p>

<p>The Iteration step size limit is an upper limit on the norm of the
displacement correction vector within one iteration. If the norm is higher
than this value, the correction vector is scaled down such that its norm
equals the specified value. Whenever this happens, the iteration counter that
is compared to the Maximum and Minimum Number of Iterations parameters of the
<a href="#Integration">Integration tab</a>, is reset to zero.</p>

<p>The <i>Perform dynamic ramp-up of loads/motions</i> option is a tool which
may be used for models with large initial external loads or prescribed motions,
that can not be applied in full as in the initial static equilibrium iterations.
With this option activated, the loads and motions at the start time will be scaled
by a <a href="../properties/function.htm#smooth-trajectory">Smooth trajectory</a>
function defined from the specified values.
A dynamics (or quasi-static) simulation is then performed over the specified
time span, in order to apply the initial loads over the given number of time steps
before the actual time-history simulation starts.</p>

<p>NOTE: Maximum and Minimum Number of Iterations set in the
<a href="#Integration">Integration tab</a> also apply in the
initial static equilibrium analysis.</p>

<p>TIP: The defaults for the <i>Equilibrium Iieration tolerance</i> and
<i>Iteration step size limit</i> are usually acceptable. However,
if the mechanism is modeled far from the equilibrium position,
reducing the Iteration step-size limit may improve performance.</p>

<p>CAUTION: The Iteration step size limit must always be larger than the
Equilibrium iteration tolerance.</p>

<p>CAUTION: To perform the static equilibrium analysis, you may have to apply
Additional Boundary Conditions on the <a href="../properties/triad.htm"> Triads</a>
before starting the simulation. For instance, in all DOFs with only inertia
(or damping) contribution and no stiffness, like unconstrained joint DOFs.</p>


<h2><a name="Output">Output tab</h2>

<p>On this tab you can control the automatic curve- and animation export from
the Dynamics Solver to file. The automatic curve export is useful if you want
to run FEDEM in an iterative loop with some external software, and need to
process selected solver output in order to calculate new input for subsequent
runs. The automatic animation export writes a GLview VTF-file with the rigid
body motion of the computed response.
This file may then be opened in the Ceetron GLview software for further viewing
(see <a href="http://www.ceetron.com">ceetron.com</a>
for further details on GLview).</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-solver-advanced6.png" width="328" height="464"></p>

<p><ol>
<li>The <i>Automatic curve export</i> toggle enables export of all curves
in the model, which has <i>Export curve automatically</i> toggled on in the
<a href="../properties/curve.htm">Curve</a> property panel.
<li>The <i>File</i> field shows path and name of the file which the curve data
will be written to.
Press the <i>Browse...</i> button to change file name or format.
<li>The <i>ASCII, tab separated</i> label below the <i>Browse...</i> button
shows the selected file format for the curve export. Available formats are
MTS RPC (UNIX or PC formatting), and tab-separated multi-column ASCII.
</ol></p>

<p>Only curves plotting results produced by the Dynamics Solver can be exported
in this manner. If you need to include curves with results from other FEDEM
solvers in the same output file (e.g., results from subsequent strain rosette
analyses), you have to run the FEDEM Curve Export Utility module instead (see
the User's Guide, "Automated curve export from multiple result database files").
</p>

<p><ol start="4">
<li>The <i>Automatic export to GLview VTF file</i> toggle enables export of
the rigid body motion of the computed response to a GLview VTF-file.
<li>The <i>File</i> field shows path and name of the VTF-file that the
animation will be written to.
Press the <i>Browse...</i> button to change file name or format.
Available formats are <i>Express</i>, <i>Binary</i> and <i>ASCII</i>,
and the chosen format is shown in front of the <i>File</i> label.
</ol></p>

<p>CAUTION: When the automatic VTF export is enabled, the FE data for all parts
in the model is written to the specified VTF file before the Dynamics Solver is
started. For large models this may take some time (especially if the FE data is
unloaded), and the FEDEM UI is blocked while the FE data is being exported.</p>

<p><ol start="6">
<li>You can enable/disable <i>Automatically start a simultaneous Rigid Body
animation on solver start</i>. This is useful when doing rapid prototyping
simulations of short duration, when it is essential to get quick feedback
on the dynamic response.
<li>You can enable/disable <i>Overwrite existing results, if any</i>.
If enabled, you don't have to delete the existing results before starting the
Dynamics Solver. Instead, the result files are overwritten and no incrementation
of the results database is performed. This means that the old results are lost,
even if you close the model without saving after a new simulation.
