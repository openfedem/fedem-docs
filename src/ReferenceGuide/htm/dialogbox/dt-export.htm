<h1><a name="_dialogbox_model-export"></a>Digital Twin Model Export</h1>

<p>The Model Export dialog box is used to export the current model into three types of
Digital Twin simulation apps; <b><i>Stream</i></b>, <b><i>Batch</i></b> and
Functional Mock-up Unit (<b><i>FMU</i></b>).</p>

<p><img src="../../img/dlg-model-export.png"></p>

<p><ul>
<li><i>File Name:</i> - For each app type, you can click the <i>Browse...</i> button
to select the name of the zip-archive that will contain the exported model.
<li><i>Input Indicator Group:</i> - Specifies the name of the group of input indicators
that will be used in the exported Stream- or Batch app. The names specified here
need to be reflected in the cloud simulation setup in <i>EPD Connected Products</i>.
<li><i>Output Indicator Group:</i> - Specifies the name of the group of output indicators
that will be used in the exported Stream app. The name specified here
needs to be reflected in the cloud simulation setup in <i>EPD Connected Products</i>.
<li><i>Window Size [sec]:</i> - Specifies the length of each time window (in seconds)
for the Stream app.
<li><i>Transfer solver state between windows</i> - Activate this toggle if each time window
should be restarted using the final state of the previous window as starting point.
If not activated, each time window will start from the modeling configuration.
<li><i>Surface Only</i> - Activate this toggle to represent all FE Parts in the model
by surface elements only, in the visualization model generated by the Batch app.
If not activated, the visualization model may be larger since it will also contain (invisible)
internal element interfaces between the solid finite elements.
<li><i>Stress Recovery</i> - Activate this toggle to let the Batch app perform deformation-
and von Mises stress recovery for those FE Parts that have the
<i>Perform stress recovery during dynamics simulation</i> toggle enabled in the
<a href="../properties/part.htm#Advanced">Advanced tab</a> of the property editor panel.
<li><i>All FE-Parts</i> - Activate this toggle to let the Batch app generate a visualization
for all FE Parts in the model. If not activated, only the Parts having the
<i>Perform stress recovery during dynamics simulation</i> toggle enabled in the
<a href="../properties/part.htm#Advanced">Advanced tab</a> of the property editor panel
will be included in the visualization.
When the <i>All FE-Parts</i> toggle is enabled, those FE Parts which are not toggled for recovery
will be represented by their rigid body motion only.
<li><i>Input Indicators:</i> - This table lists all
<a href="../properties/function.htm#external-function">External function</a>s in the model
(their <i>Tag</i> and <i>Description</i>, respectively.
They will define the content of the named Input Indicator Group.
<li><i>Output Indicators:</i> - This table lists all
<a href="../properties/function.htm">Function</a>s in the model,
that have the <i>Use as output sensor</i> toggle enabled in the property editor panel.
Their <i>Tag</i> and <i>Description</i>, respectively,
are listed, in addition to the description of the
<a href="../properties/function.htm#threshold">Threshold</a> settings, if that is enabled.
</ul></p>

<p>Pressing the <i>Export</i> button will perform the model export for all of the
three app types which have the respective activation toggle enabled.
The exported zip-file will contain all files related to the current model,
in addition to some support files for executing the model in the cloud.
The FMU will in addition contain shared object libraries interfacing the dynamics solver
based on the <a href="https://fmi-standard.org">Functional Mock-up Interface</a>,
such that it can be executed on both Windows and Linux systems.</p>
